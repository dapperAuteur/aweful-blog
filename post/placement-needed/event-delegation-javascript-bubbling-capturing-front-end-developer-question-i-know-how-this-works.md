# Event Delegation JavaScript Bubbling Capturing Front End Developer Question I Know How this Works



![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*ToORCSmu7xpqbGF6.jpg)

Using event delegation allows the developer to write less code to get the same result. This is explained very well in the MakingDevelopers YouTube video linked below. I’ll attempt to do it justice with text here. There are two types of event delegation; bubbling and capturing. Using bubbling the developer can send a signal from the child element to the parent element. The signal flows upstream, bubbling up. Using capturing the developer can send a signal from the parent element to the child element. The signal flows down stream.
